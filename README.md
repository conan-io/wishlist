# Conan Wishlist

## DEPRECATION NOTICE: Use  [Conan Center Index repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) instead.

This repository tracked user wishes for new Conan recipes prior to the start of the [Conan Center Index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index).

If a Conan package does not exist in the Index yet, please search the issues first if someone else already made a request for the library or tool you would like to have.

If such a request does not exist, feel free to [create](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/new?labels=library+request&template=package_request.md&title=%5Brequest%5D+%3CLIBRARY-NAME%3E%2F%3CLIBRARY-VERSION%3E) one.

Existing issues in this repository will be closed and / or moved to the Index over time.
